### **_Group Log (3/11/2024)_
Please review frontend setup 1 pull request. I reorganized the directory.

Please note before merging, save your .env files for the backend and place it in _src/backend_. This is to separate node modules for the backend and the front end.

Also, please install dependencies:

```
npm install

```
In both _src/backend_ and _src/client_.

React will be deployed in localhost:3000, while fetching the data in localhost:8800.
